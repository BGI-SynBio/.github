# mMPS (microchip-based Massive in Parallel DNA Synthesis) Technology

To reduce the cost, increase the throughput, and ensure the fidelity of synthetic DNA, 
we developed the microchip-based Massive in Parallel Synthesis (mMPS) technology. 
Through massive microchips parallel synthesis and following rounds of "identification-sorting-synthesis-pooling", 
the mMPS technology allows thousands of millions of oligos to be synthesized concurrently.
