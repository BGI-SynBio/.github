# Synthetic yeast genome Sc2.0

The synthetic yeast genome project (Sc2.0) is a milestone project in synthetic genomics. 
Together with our collaborators, we contribute on the design and 
*de novo* synthesis of three chromosomes of Saccharomyces Cerevisiae (II, VII and XIII) 
and also developed tools for this project. 
Synthetic genomes with designer features enable the creation of cells with enhanced biological functions 
and unique properties as exemplified by the inducible evolution system called SCRaMbLE that is embedded in the Sc2.0 yeast strains. 
By exploring the enormous amount of genomic diversity post-SCRaMbLE, 
we can rapidly acquire mutant strains with improved capability to produce bioproducts for industrial applications
