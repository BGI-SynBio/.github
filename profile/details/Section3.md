# DNA data storage

DNA molecules, as the carriers of genetic information for billions of years in living organisms, 
are now also considered as a potential storage medium for digital information in the rapidly developing field of big data. 
Compared to conventional storage media such as optical discs, hard drives, and flash drives, 
DNA molecules have a series of advantages including high information storage density, 
low maintenance costs, long-term stability, and data security. 
Typically, the process of DNA storage involves 5-6 steps, with research on encoding and decoding methods leaning more towards information technology, 
while the synthesis, sequencing, and manipulation of DNA require more biological technology research. 
We have made significant progress in almost every step of the DNA storage process. 
In terms of encoding, we are dedicated to developing efficient and stable encoding algorithms. 
For decoding, we have developed graph-based data recovery and error correction algorithms 
to address the inevitable experimental errors in DNA storage. Regarding DNA information writing, 
we have developed an information writing method based on a standard reusable library, inspired by the principles of movable type printing. 
For DNA information reading, we are researching real-time base prediction and error correction methods to enable instant information retrieval.
