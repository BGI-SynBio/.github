# Genetic codon expansion in eukaryotic system

We aims to build synthetic organism for protein function innovation via combination of "chassis" and "tools", 
which requires the reprogramming the entire genome of target chassis cells, 
and developing translation tools with designed functions. 
Our efforts will open the door to promising applications 
such as the biosynthesis of unnatural polymers consisting of noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs), 
biocontainment of genetically modified organisms 
and the generation of virus-resistant cells used for producing therapeutic biologics.
