With the enabling synbio technology innovations, 
our team focus on the development of genome writing technology and applications. 
By designing and constructing the genome of organisms from the scratch, 
we explore the basic laws of life activities (creation to knowledge) and 
apply artificial organisms as chassis cells in the fields of bio-manufacturing, disease treatment, DNA storage, etc, 
leading a new paradigm for synthetic biology research and industry.

- **mMPS** (**m**icrochip-based **M**assive in **P**arallel DNA **S**ynthesis) **Technology**

To reduce the cost, increase the throughput, and ensure the fidelity of synthetic DNA,
we developed the microchip-based Massive in Parallel Synthesis (mMPS) technology.
Through massive microchips parallel synthesis and following rounds of "identification-sorting-synthesis-pooling",
the mMPS technology allows thousands of millions of oligos to be synthesized concurrently.

- **Synthetic yeast genome Sc2.0**

The synthetic yeast genome project (Sc2.0) is a milestone project in synthetic genomics. 
Together with our collaborators, we contribute on the design and de novo synthesis of 
three chromosomes of Saccharomyces Cerevisiae (II, VII and XIII) and also developed tools for this project.

- **Genetic codon expansion in eukaryotic system**

We aims to build artificial organism for protein function innovation via combination of "chassis" and "tools", 
which requires the reprogramming the entire genome of target chassis cells, and developing translation tools with designed functions. 
Our efforts will enable biomedicine, biological intelligent manufacturing, 
life process regulation and other cutting-edge basic research and industrial application direction. 

- **DNA data storage**

DNA molecules, as the carriers of genetic information for billions of years in living organisms, 
are now also considered as a potential storage medium for digital information in the rapidly developing field of big data. 
Compared to traditional storage media such as optical discs, hard drives, and flash drives, DNA molecules have a series of advantages 
including high information storage density, low maintenance costs, long-term stability, and data security. 
Typically, the process of DNA data storage involves 5-6 steps, with research on encoding and decoding methods leaning more towards information technology, 
while the synthesis, sequencing, and manipulation of DNA require more biological technology research. 
We has made significant progress in almost every step of the DNA storage process. 
In terms of encoding, we are dedicated to developing efficient and stable encoding algorithms. 
For decoding, we have developed graph theorye-based data recovery and error correction algorithms to address the inevitable experimental errors in DNA storage. 
Regarding DNA information writing, we have developed an information writing method based on a standard reusable library. Inspired by the principles of movable type printing. 
For DNA information reading, we are researching real-time base prediction and error correction methods to enable instant information retrieval.
