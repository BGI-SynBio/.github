With the enabling SynBio technology innovations, 
our team focus on the development of genome writing technology and applications. 
By designing and constructing the genome of organisms from the scratch, 
we explore the basic laws of life activities (creation to knowledge) and 
apply artificial organisms as chassis cells in the fields of bio-manufacturing, disease treatment, Bioinformatics algorithms, DNA data storage, etc, 
leading a new paradigm for synthetic biology research and industry.

- **mMPS** (**m**icrochip-based **M**assive in **P**arallel DNA **S**ynthesis) **Technology**

    To reduce the cost, increase the throughput, and ensure the fidelity of synthetic DNA,
we developed the microchip-based Massive in Parallel Synthesis (mMPS) technology.

- **Synthetic yeast genome Sc2.0**

    The Synthetic Yeast Genome Project (Sc2.0) is a global consortium working to develop the first synthetic eukaryote genome from scratch.

- **Genetic codon expansion in eukaryotic system**

    We aims to build artificial organism for protein function innovation via combination of "chassis" and "tools", 
which requires the reprogramming the entire genome of target chassis cells, and developing translation tools with designed functions. 

- **DNA data storage**

    We have made significant progress in almost aspects of DNA data storage.
