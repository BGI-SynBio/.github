With the enabling SynBio technology innovations, 
our team focus on the development of genome writing technology and applications. 
By designing and constructing the genome of organisms from the scratch, 
we explore the basic laws of life activities (creation to knowledge) and 
apply artificial organisms as chassis cells in the fields of bio-manufacturing, disease treatment, DNA-based data storage, etc, 
leading a new paradigm for synthetic biology research and industry.

- [**mMPS (microchip-based Massive in Parallel DNA Synthesis) Technology**](https://github.com/BGI-SynBio/.github/blob/main/profile/details/Section1.md)

    Our goal is to reduce the cost, increase the throughput, and ensure the fidelity of synthetic DNA.


- [**Synthetic yeast genome Sc2.0**](https://github.com/BGI-SynBio/.github/blob/main/profile/details/Section1.md)

    The Synthetic Yeast Genome Project is a global consortium working to develop the first synthetic eukaryote genome from scratch.

- [**Genetic codon expansion in eukaryotic system**](https://github.com/BGI-SynBio/.github/blob/main/profile/details/Section3.md)

    We aim to build artificial organism for protein function innovation via combination of "chassis" and "tools". 

- [**DNA-based data storage**](https://github.com/BGI-SynBio/.github/blob/main/profile/details/Section4.md)

    We have made significant progress in almost aspects of DNA-based data storage.
